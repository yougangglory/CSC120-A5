- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
It makes the coding more easier and clear on the programmer perspective . Association makes programming easier, it makes the code easier to read for a human and it helps implement each object ad test each part of the code seperately. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 
I was able to create the Banner, Boot, Pants, shirts. The Scracrow is displaying very well. I did not figure out how to pass the message of the command line to the banner. I have an idea and I commented it in the scarecrow class but if I implement it, the program won't run on visual code. It would only run the commend line. An advice I can tell to others is to be creative, have fun and try to do everything and if it doesn't work, seek for help.
